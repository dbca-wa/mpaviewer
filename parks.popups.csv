Marmion Marine Park,"Marmion Marine Park is offshore from Perth's northern suburbs between Trigg Island and Burns Beach. The marine park includes Mettams Pool, Hillarys Boat Harbour and Ocean Reef Boat Harbour.

Marmion Marine Park consists of three zone types: 'no-take' sanctuary zones, Watermans Reef Observation Area and a general use zone."
Rottnest Marine Park,"Rottnest Island is a A Class Reserve, abundant in flora and fauna including thousands of quokkas. It boasts some of the world's finest beaches and bays. Five marine sanctuary zones surround the island.

The island also has a deep connection and history. It has cultural and spiritual significance for Aboriginal communities across Western Australia."
Ningaloo Marine Park,"Ningaloo Marine Park is World Heritage-listed and one of the largest fringing reefs home to hundreds of fish and coral species, making snorkelling as easy as a short paddle from shore. 

There’s more than just fish to see, organise a guided experience with whale sharks, humpback whales, manta rays, turtles, dolphins or dugongs! If you’d rather stay dry, get a glimpse of the reef via a glass bottom boat tour. "
