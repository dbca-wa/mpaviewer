This indicator, commonly referred to as the Reef Fish Temperature Index (RFTI),
is a community weighted mean of the thermal affinity for each fish species
recorded on a survey. <br>

This indicator theoretically increases as temperatures 
rise and vice versa. Spatial variations in the indicator are often non-linear, 
as the communities in a given region are usually highly similar, and a large step 
in values occurs as temperate communities give way to tropical, for example 
(Stuart-Smith et al. 2015). This indicator is most powerful for tracking change 
through time, and especially in locations that are well connected to sources of fish 
larvae from other regions. Change is influenced by the thermal composition of the 
community (Burrows et al. 2019).
