*Montebello Islands Marine Park*

The Montebello Islands has lots to offer ocean lovers. 265 low-lying islands and islets are waiting to be explored. These islands are a conservation park and the waters surrounding the islands are a marine park. You’ll never get bored of the same dive sites or snorkelling locations the park has dozens to choose from! See loads of colourful tropical fish and explore the islands’ many coral reefs. Above the water line swimmers and kayakers can enjoy picturesque views of the islands and turquoise waters.

These waters and islands are also important for threatened sea turtles, so you’ll likely catch a glimpse of these ancient mariners, as well as dolphins, dugongs and various species of seabird and shorebirds.
