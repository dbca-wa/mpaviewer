North Kimberley is the largest marine park in Western Australia. At 1,845,000 hectares, it’s seven times the area of Ningaloo Marine Park. Its super-size makes it the second largest State marine park in Australia.  

Discover some of the most pristine reefs in the world. The coral reefs of the north Kimberley have the richest marine life in Western Australia. Remarkable animals that call this home include dugongs, sea turtles and sawfish. Catching a big barramundi is on most people’s bucket list. Help protect this wonderful area and fish responsibly outside sanctuary zones.

Aboriginal people have significant cultural, spiritual and social connections to the sea country of the North Kimberley. The marine park will be jointly managed by traditional owners.  It’s good to know it’s in safe hands!
