*Shoalwater Marine Park*

Cavernous reefs provide excellent diving and snorkelling opportunities. Grab a permit and you can explore a dive wreck or check out the surf break to the west of Penguin Island. 

Hop aboard a wildlife cruise and swim with the dolphins or a kayak tour and learn about the local marine residents including the rare Australian sea lion. You’ll find them lazing about on their own island – Seal Island of course! Learn more about being Seal Wise.

Launch your tinnie for a spot of fishing or crabbing (just check the zoning maps in the park brochure), or when the wind picks up, the wind and kite surfing is great. 

The birdlife is abundant and can be appreciated on the purpose-built network of boardwalks along the coastline and on Penguin Island – look up to see the pelicans soaring above or down below where you might see fluffy chicks and their protective parents still in their nest.
