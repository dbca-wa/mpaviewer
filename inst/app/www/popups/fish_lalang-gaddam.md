*Lalang-garram Marine Park*

Lalang-garram/Camden Sound Marine Park is the most important humpback whale nursery in the southern hemisphere. From June-September each year, thousands of humpback whales come here to breed, calve and nurse their young in the protected bays of Camden Sound. 

These amazing creatures have just migrated from their feeding grounds in the Antarctic. That’s a big swim!  

The tropical waters of the park offer an ideal area for newborn humpback calves to build up blubber. They’ll need all their strength for the return journey. It’s great that they can hide from predators in the park’s sheltered waters.
