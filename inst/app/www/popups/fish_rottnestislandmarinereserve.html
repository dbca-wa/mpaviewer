*Rottnest Island Marine Reserve*

When you dive beneath the surface on Wadjemup, a whole new world is revealed with some of the most biodiverse marine gardens you’ll find anywhere. Approximately 400 species of fish and 20 species of coral call Rottnest Island home, and snorkelers, divers, and swimmers all have access to these underwater living sanctuaries.

The island’s marine sanctuary zones are in place to protect important marine reserves. It's part of conserving the ocean's biodiversity, as well as preserving the beauty of these underwater parks.

There are five marine sanctuary zones, each one with their own unique character:

- Parker Point 
- Kingston Reef 
- Green Island 
- Armstrong Bay 
- West End
