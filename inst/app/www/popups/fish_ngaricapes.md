*Ngari Capes Marine Park*

Ngari Capes Marine Park extends from Busselton to Augusta. It features fabulous underwater landscapes and is a great spot for all types of water-based fun. In winter and spring, humpback and southern right whales migrate through Ngari Capes. Blue whales, the largest living animals on Earth, have been seen in Geographe Bay, particularly during November.

Several licensed operators offer whale-watching boat tours. Alternatively, wait patiently at Cape Naturaliste, Sugar Loaf Rock, Conto Spring and Cape Leeuwin. You could get a lucky sighting from these good vantage points. But before heading into the water, bustle down to the Busselton Jetty - it’s the longest wooden jetty in the Southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1865 and it took 95 years to complete. Not far-fetched as it stretches almost 2km into the Geographe Bay! It’s a good spot to fish and dive.

The marine park is a watery wonderland for water activities. Swim and snorkel in sheltered bays, discover glorious coral reefs and abundant fish life. Qualified divers can explore the underwater wreck of HMAS Swan.
