*Shark Bay Marine Park*

Shark Bay Marine Park is valued for its rich and abundant marine life. It’s part of the Shark Bay World Heritage Area. The stars of the park are the famous Monkey Mia bottlenose dolphins. They attract visitors from all over the world. The reserve also has turtles, dugongs, humpback whales and sharks.

Come to swim, snorkel and canoe in the many bays and inlets. A population of more than 10,000 dugongs thrive in the vast meadows of seagrass. Will you be lucky and spot one? There are so many types of fish, at least 320 species! Look out too, for prawns, scallops, seasnakes and gardens of sponges.

Diving is a popular way to catch the activity and beauty below the waves. More than 80 species of coral live in the reserve. Private dive charters are available and recommended if you don’t have good local knowledge.
