*Jurien Bay Marine Park*

The Jurien Bay Marine Park is unique world-wide for the extensive limestone reef system that runs parallel to this section of the Western Australian coastline. The park extends from Wedge Island to Greenhead and 5.5 km offshore. 

The marine waters encompass numerous island nature reserves and important seagrass meadows critical for the survival of many marine and terrestrial plants and animals. 

The park was declared in 2003 and is representative of a temperate reef existing at its northern most limits. 

The influence of the southern flowing Leeuwin current on these reefs can be seen in the existence of tropical corals within areas of seagrass and stands of cool water macro-algae.
