*Ningaloo Marine Park*

Ningaloo Marine Park is World Heritage-listed and one of the largest fringing reefs home to hundreds of fish and coral species, making snorkelling as easy as a short paddle from shore. 

There’s more than just fish to see, organise a guided experience with whale sharks, humpback whales, manta rays, turtles, dolphins or dugongs! If you’d rather stay dry, get a glimpse of the reef via a glass bottom boat tour.
