*Marmion Marine Park*

Marmion Marine Park is offshore from Perth's northern suburbs between Trigg Island and Burns Beach. The marine park includes Mettams Pool, Hillarys Boat Harbour and Ocean Reef Boat Harbour.

Marmion Marine Park consists of three zone types: 'no-take' sanctuary zones, Watermans Reef Observation Area and a general use zone.
