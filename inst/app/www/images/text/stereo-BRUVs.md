## Stereo-BRUVs

### The Systems
Baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) are a popular tool to 
sample shallow and deep water demersal fish assemblages and gather data on their relative 
abundance and body size structure in a robust, cost-effective and non-invasive manner. The use of 
bait with remote underwater video systems increases the relative abundance 
and diversity of fishes observed, particularly species targeted by fisheries, without 
precluding fishes not attracted to bait. The systems consist of a frame, protecting 
two inward converging cameras inside waterproof housings mounted to a base bar with 
a baited container fixed in front of the cameras.

Stereo-BRUVs deployments are typically 60 minutes in duration.

### Where Are They Used?
Stereo-BRUVs have been used as a monitoring tool by DBCA in all West Australian marine 
parks excluding the Kimberley region and Walpole & Nornalup Inlet marine parks.
