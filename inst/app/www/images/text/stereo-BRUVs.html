    <h3 id="the-systems">The Systems</h3>
    <p>Baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) are a popular tool to
sample demersal fish assemblages and gather data on their relative abundance and
body size structure in a robust, cost-effective and non-invasive manner. The use of
bait with remote underwater video systems increases the relative abundance
and diversity of fishes observed, particularly species targeted by fisheries, without
precluding fishes not attracted to bait. The systems consist of a frame, protecting
two inward converging cameras inside waterproof housings mounted to a base bar with
a baited container fixed in front of the cameras.</p>
    <p>Stereo-BRUVs deployments are typically 60 minutes in duration.</p>
    <h3 id="where-are-they-used">Where Are They Used?</h3>
    <p>Stereo-BRUVs have been used as a monitoring tool by DBCA in all West Australian marine
parks excluding the Kimberley region and Walpole &amp; Nornalup Inlet marine parks.</p>
