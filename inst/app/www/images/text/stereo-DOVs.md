## Stereo-DOVs

### The Systems
Diver operated stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) are an observational sampling tool 
that are best used for transect surveys of non-cryptic shallow water reef fish assemblages. 
They are frequently used as an alternative to traditional underwater visual census (UVC) surveys 
as they overcome many of the associated biases. Stereo-DOVs are able to simultaneously 
collect information on the abundance, behaviour of fishes as well as capturing habitat 
type and complexity. Using a two camera configuration (stereo) allows for very accurate 
length estimates of fish as well as measuremetns of sampling area. The systems consists 
of two inward converging cameras inside waterproof housings mounted to a base bar with 
handholds for use by divers. Often a cotton couter device is mounted to the basebar and 
used to measure transect length.

Stereo-DOVs surveys will often consist of 6 x 50m transects at each site.

### Where Are They Used?
Stereo-DOVs are currently used as a monitoring tool by DBCA at the Metro, Rottnest Island, 
Jurien Bay, Shark Bay, Ningaloo, Montebellos and Rowley Shoals marine parks.
