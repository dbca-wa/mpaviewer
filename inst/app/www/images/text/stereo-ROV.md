## Stereo-ROV

### The Systems
Remote operated vehicle stereo-video systems (stereo-ROV) are an observational sampling tool 
that are best used for transect surveys of non-cryptic shallow water reef fish assemblages. 
The method offers many of the same benefits of stereo-DOVs but the benefit of being able to sample 
in deeper waters and areas where divers might not be able to safely access. Other benefits include 
potential unlimited run time, increased sampling efficiency in the field and the ability to 
record exact transect positioning using GPS and acoustic positioning. The system consists of 
a stereo-camera basebar (similar to stereo-DOVs) that is mounted to an observational class 
remote operated vehicle (ROV). 

Stereo-ROV surveys will often consist of 6 x 50m transects at each site.

### Where Are They Used?
Stereo-ROV are currently used as a monitoring tool by DBCA at the Jurien Bay, Lalang-garrum and 
North Kimberley marine parks.
