    <h3 id="the-systems">The Systems</h3>
    <p>Diver operated stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) are an observational sampling tool
that are best used for transect surveys of non-cryptic shallow water reef fish assemblages.
They are frequently used as an alternative to traditional underwater visual census (UVC) surveys
as they overcome many of the associated biases. Stereo-DOVs are able to simultaneously
collect information on the abundance, behaviour of fishes as well as capturing habitat
type and complexity. Using a two camera configuration (stereo) allows for very accurate
length estimates of fish as well as measuremetns of sampling area. The systems consists
of two inward converging cameras inside waterproof housings mounted to a base bar with
handholds for use by divers. Often a cotton couter device is mounted to the basebar and
used to measure transect length.</p>
    <p>Stereo-DOVs surveys will often consist of 6 x 50m transects at each site.</p>
    <h3 id="where-are-they-used">Where Are They Used?</h3>
    <p>Stereo-DOVs are currently used as a monitoring tool by DBCA at the Metro, Rottnest Island,
Jurien Bay, Shark Bay, Ningaloo, Montebellos and Rowley Shoals marine parks.</p>
