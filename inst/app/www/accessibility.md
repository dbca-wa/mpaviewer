Hyperlinks
Wherever possible, hyperlinks contain descriptions of information found in the link’s destination.

All links open in the same window to improve usability for people with vision impairment, with the exception of links to documents, which open in a new window.

# Images
All images that are used to display a meaning will have alternative text available. Some browsers may also display a tooltip of this alternative text when the cursor hovers or focuses on the image. Images that are used for decorative purposes only do not contain any alternative text.

# Tables
Where possible tables are only used to display tabular information and are not used for formatting. Row and column headings have been identified using HTML for use with assistive technologies. On our pages which display many publications we have chosen to display these publications in a tabular format to allow ease of access to multiple formats.

# Document attachments
Where possible, pdf documents have also been provided in Microsoft Word format (.doc). In some cases we may not be able to provide Microsoft Word versions. For example, documents that have been produced by a third party such as submissions or scanned documents. All document attachments will open in the same browser window. Users will be notified where document attachments open in a new browser window.

Contact us using the feedback button on the right to request alternate document formats.
